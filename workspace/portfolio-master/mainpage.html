        <div class="about_me">
            <p>It was never a dream of mine to become a designer.  At least not visually, anyway.  Yes.  I wanted to design, but I wanted to use my words, a pen and paper.  I wanted to design a world that people could imagine and get lost in.  A world that would make people be feel better and be better.  But fate is funny.  Today, I am a designer.  I only design in a different way but for the same reason.  Now I design visuals and experiences that can help people be better and do better.  Now, I design with colors and shapes.</p>

            <p> <em> Budget Break</em>  is a budgeting app that allows its users to create a budget, save money, and see their spending habits.  My design decisions were based on what users were looking for in a budgeting app.  Simple and easy to use.  I decided to use the concept of Flat Design.</p>
